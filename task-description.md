7. Clicking on the button will take the user to the Checkout route. This route will be private/protected routes. Please make sure that the private route redirects to the login page if the user is not logged in. After login, the user will be redirected to the checkout page

8. You can put anything on the checkout page. If you want to do some extra optional work, please read the optional but highly recommended section of this description.

4. Clean and organized Code. Organize components and add comments when needed
5. Display error when user email address or password don't match. 
6. Send Email Verification. Don't worry if the email goes to the spam folder or it doesn't go at all. As long as your code is there, you will be fine.

### Optional But Highly Recommended:
1. Your checkout page will be a dynamic route with route parameter having the id of the service user created. In the checkout page, you will have a simple form that you will have fields for user name, user email address, address, and phone number. Once the user submits the form, you will display the  user, `thank you for the booking.`
2. Use the Environment variable to hide the firebase key
3. Add active routes to see which route you are.
4. If possible, make the entire website responsive. Once you are done making the home page responsive, you wont need much things to do to make the entire website responsive. 

### Optional:
1. For the Checkout page, you can use basic html form or any css library. However, we encourage you to try out the `react hook form`.
3. Add some mouseover animation while taking the mouse on the services card
4. If you want to take a challenge. consider using `react-leaflet` anywhere in your application
5. Please Use icons whenever applicable and use fonts
6. Make the footer a little more realistic
7. Optimize your images
8. Add something extra of your own. This will help you in the future to differentiate your project from others.

### Additional information:
1. If needed, create your own fake data. You can load the data from a `.json` file or host it anywhere you want. 
2. You can use a local image or host image anywhere or both.
3. You are free to use any CSS library (bootstrap, tailwind) you want. if you want, you can use both `bootstrap` and `react-bootstrap`. Also, if  you want, you can use any `tailwind` component library.
4. If needed you can mix CSS framework with a component library
5. Try to host your site on Firebase (netlifiy host will need extra configuration)
6. If you have any issues with hosting or Github push, please join the Github and deploy a related support session

### What to submit: 
1. Your Github repository
2. Your live website link

### Some Guidelines:
1. Do not waste much time on the website idea. Just spend 30 minutes deciding, find a sample website, and start working on it.
2. Do not waste much time finding the right image. You can always start with a simple idea. Make the website and then add different images.
3. Don't look at the overall task list. Just take one task at a time and do it. Once that is done, pick the next task. If you got stuck on one task, move on to the next task.
2. Stay calm, think and work sequentially. You will make it.
